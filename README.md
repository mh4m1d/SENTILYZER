# SENTILYZER

an application which we made for our first semester PF project, it inspects one's sentiments using text.

SENTILYZER is a C++ application that analyzes your sentiments using basic strings. Currently, it is limited to CLI (terminal/console) but in the near future, it will become a valuable tool for gaining insights into customer opinions and preferences, as well as for business strategies and social media posts.
